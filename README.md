# Very Simple Portfolio (literally very simple)

### A very simple portfolio page made with HTML, CSS & JS.

- First of all, this is my first open source project. So please show me some respect and star my project. ðŸ¤ 
- Used isotope, typed, owlcarousel and more stuffs.
- Responsive & mobile-friendly. (I think so ðŸ¤ )
- And yes, It's not very pleasing to eyes, I know.
